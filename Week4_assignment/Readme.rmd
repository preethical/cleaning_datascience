#README document for the run_analysis program. 
This was a part of the Getting and Cleaning Data course in the Data Science Specialization. 
The data for the project was from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphones accelorometer. 
The data for the project was obtained from (link) ["https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip]

The dataset given includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.


The run_analysis script works on the assumption that the file has been downloaded and extracted and placed in the working directory. 

First the two libraries data.table and dplyr are loaded. 

After which text files with the meta data are read (i.e. the features_info.txt and the activity_labels.txt)
